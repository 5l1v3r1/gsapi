<snippet><content><![CDATA[try to continue without verification=${1}]]></content>    <description> /0 = follow exact verification steps (default)1 = try to skip verification and continueExample: try to continue without verification=1When used in a REGISTER_STEP1 section, this would skip e.g. the email verification and try to login and submit your link. In case this goes wrong there is still the normal way to go on (wait verification + login + submit). If the result of a registration is unknown as well as login, then it doesnt continue for now but wait till registration is verified.</description>    <tabTrigger>try to continue without verification</tabTrigger></snippet>
