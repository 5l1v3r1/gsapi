<snippet><content><![CDATA[verify search detail url=${1}]]></content>    <description> /1 = If a URL has been located with your wanted data (URL) on it then the verification would normally be finished. Though sometimes you end up with a link not as good as it can be. This is especially the case if you use “search” in “verify by”. In this case a better URL is located by seeing if a DETAIL or MORE or alike link is showing your URL as well. This is by default enabled. Set it to 0 if you think the resulting URL is the best it can find.Example: verify search detail url=1</description>    <tabTrigger>verify search detail url</tabTrigger></snippet>
